# Deploy Project

Let's deploy our stack and verify everything behaves as expected:

```bash
npm run deploy
```

After the stack is synthesized and the assets are bundled, you should see a prompt to confirm IAM changes:

import iamReview from "./assets/iam-review.png";

<Screenshot src={iamReview} />

:::caution

If you don't see a prompt like the one above, please review the [setup guide](./setup) to make sure your environment is properly configured.

:::

It's good practice to review these changes to ensure we are only granting the expected permissions.
In this case we can see we are granting:

- `lambda` service principal permission to `sts:AssumeRole` against the `SayFunction` role.
- `states` service principal permission to `sts:AssumeRole` against the `Workflow` role.
- `Workflow` role permission to `lambda:InvokeFunction` against `SayFunction.Arn`.

These values match what we would expect, so we can type `y <enter>` to continue with deployment.

After the deployment completes, you should see an output similar to the one below:

import deploymentConfirmation from "./assets/deployment-confirmation.png";

<Screenshot src={deploymentConfirmation} />

Before we wrap up, let's [clean up our stack](./clean-up).
