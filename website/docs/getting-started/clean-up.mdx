# Clean Up

We can teardown the stack we just created by running:

```bash
npx cdk destroy
```

CDK will prompt you to confirm that you'd like to destroy your stack:

import confirmDestroy from "./assets/confirm-destroy.png";

<Screenshot src={confirmDestroy} />

Typing `y <enter>` will confirm that you want to destroy your stack.
You will see the status update as the stack resources are deleted.
Once everything has been deleted, you should get a confirmation that your stack has been destroyed:

import stackDestroyed from "./assets/stack-destroyed.png";

<Screenshot src={stackDestroyed} />

:::tip

Cleaning up development stacks is good practice to avoid running into resource limits and to ensure your stack is deployable from scratch.

## Wrapping Up

We've only scratched the surface of what you can build with Functionless and we're hard at work [adding new functionality on a weekly basis][releases].

You can read more about the [Step Function][step-function] and [Function][function] Constructs we used in this guide in our concepts documentation.
This is also a good place to learn about other Constructs and features that were not included in this guide.

If you'd like to keep up with the project, please [star us on GitHub][github].
We're also [active on discord][discord] if you'd like some help or just want to share something exciting you've built with Functionless.
