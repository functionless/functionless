# Integrations

`functionless` makes configuring services like AWS Step Functions and Appsync as easy as writing TypeScript functions. To get started, you only need to wrap your Constructs with the Functionless type-safe extension classes, `Function` and `Table`, and then write your business logic with `AppsyncResolver`, `StepFunction` or `ExpressStepFunction`.

- [$AWS](./01-aws.md) SDK.
- [Table](./02-table.md)
- [Function](./03-function.md)
- [AppsyncResolver](./04-appsync/00-resolver.md)
- [StepFunction](./05-stepfunctions/00-stepfunction.md)
- [EventBridge](./06-eventbridge/00-eventbridge.md)
