# Event Bridge

Functionless makes using Event Bridge easy by leveraging typescript instead of AWS Event Bridge's proprietary logic and transform configuration.

Event Bridge can:

- Create Rules (`EventBusRule`) on a Event Bus to match incoming events.
- Transform the event before sending to some services like `Lambda` Functions.
- Target other AWS services like Lambda and other Event Buses

Functionless uses a wrapped version of CDK's Event Bus, lets create a CDK event bus first.

```ts
// Create a new Event Bus using CDK.
const bus = new functionless.EventBus(this, "myBus");

// Functionless also supports using the default bus or importing an Event Bus.
const awsBus = functionless.EventBus.fromBus(
  new aws_events.EventBus(this, "awsBus")
);
const defaultBus = functionless.EventBus.fromBus(
  aws_events.EventBus.fromEventBusName(this, "defaultBus", "default")
);
const importedBus = functionless.EventBus.fromBus(
  aws_events.EventBus.fromEventBusArn(this, "defaultBus", arn)
);
```

Functionless supports well typed events, lets add our event schema to Typescript.

```ts
interface UserDetails {
  id?: string;
  name: string;
  age: number;
  interests: string[];
}

interface UserEvent
  extends functionless.EventBusRuleInput<
    UserDetails,
    // We can provide custom detail-types to match on
    "Create" | "Update" | "Delete"
  > {}
```

#### Create Rules (`EventBusRule`) on a Event Bus to match incoming events.

Now that you have a wrapped `EventBus`, lets add some rules.

Functionless lets you write logic in Typescript on the type safe event.

Lets match all of the `Create` or `Update` events with one rule and another rule for `Delete`s.

```ts
const createOrUpdateEvents = bus.when(
  this,
  "createOrUpdateRule",
  (event) =>
    event["detail-type"] === "Create" || event["detail-type"] === "Update"
);
const deleteEvents = bus.when(
  this,
  "deleteRule",
  (event) => event["detail-type"] === "Delete"
);
```

We also want to do something special when we get a new cat lover who is between 18 and 30 years old, lets make another rule for those.

```ts
const catPeopleEvents = bus.when(
  (event) =>
    event["detail-type"] === "Create" &&
    event.detail.interests.includes("CATS") &&
    event.detail.age >= 18 &&
    event.detail.age < 30
);
```

#### Transform the event before sending to some services like `Lambda` Functions.

We have two lambda functions to invoke, one for create or updates and another for deletes, lets make those.

```ts
const createOrUpdateFunction = new aws_lambda.Function(this, 'createOrUpdate', ...);
const deleteFunction = new aws_lambda.Function(this, 'delete', ...);
```

and wrap them with Functionless's `Function` wrapper, including given them input types.

```ts
interface CreateOrUpdate {
  id?: string;
  name: string;
  age: number;
  operation: "Create" | "Update";
  interests: string[];
}

interface Delete {
  id: string;
}

const createOrUpdateOperation = functionless.Function<CreateOrUpdate, void>(
  createOrUpdateFunction
);
const deleteOperation = functionless.Function<Delete, void>(
  createOrUpdateFunction
);
```

The events from before do not match the formats from before, so lets transform them to the structures match.

```ts
const createOrUpdateEventsTransformed =
  createOrUpdateEvents.map<CreateOrUpdate>((event) => ({
    id: event.detail.id,
    name: event.detai.name,
    age: event.detail.age,
    operation: event["detail-type"],
    interests: event.detail.interests,
  }));

const deleteEventsTransformed = createOrUpdateEvents.map<Delete>((event) => ({
  id: event.detail.id,
}));
```

#### Target other AWS services like Lambda and other Event Buses

Now that we have created rules on our event buses using `when` and transformed those matched events using `map`, we need to send the events somewhere.

We can `pipe` the transformed events to the lambda functions we defined earlier.

```ts
createOrUpdateEventsTransformed.pipe(createOrUpdateOperation);
deleteEventsTransformed.pipe(deleteOperation);
```

What about our young cat lovers? We want to forward those events to our sister team's event bus for processing.

```ts
const catPeopleBus = functionless.EventBus.fromBus(
  aws_events.EventBus.fromEventBusArn(this, "catTeamBus", catTeamBusArn)
);

// Note: EventBridge does not support transforming events which target other event buses. These events are sent as is.
catPeopleEvents.pipe(catPeopleBus);
```

#### Summary

Lets look at the above all together.

```ts
interface UserDetails {
  id?: string;
  name: string;
  age: number;
  interests: string[];
}

interface UserEvent
  extends functionless.EventBusRuleInput<
    UserDetails,
    // We can provide custom detail-types to match on
    "Create" | "Update" | "Delete"
  > {}

interface CreateOrUpdate {
  id?: string;
  name: string;
  age: number;
  operation: "Create" | "Update";
  interests: string[];
}

interface Delete {
  id: string;
}

const createOrUpdateFunction = new functionless.Function<CreateOrUpdate, void>(
  new aws_lambda.Function(this, "createOrUpdate", { ... })
);

const deleteFunction = new functionless.Function<Delete, void>(
  new aws_lambda.Function(this, "delete", { ... })
);

const bus = new functionless.EventBus<UserEvent>(this, "myBus");

// Create and update events are sent to a spcific lambda function.
bus
  .when(
    this,
    "createOrUpdateRule",
    (event) =>
      event["detail-type"] === "Create" || event["detail-type"] === "Update"
  )
  .map<CreateOrUpdate>((event) => ({
    id: event.detail.id,
    name: event.detail.name,
    age: event.detail.age,
    operation: event["detail-type"] as "Create" | "Update",
    interests: event.detail.interests,
  }))
  .pipe(createOrUpdateFunction);

// Delete events are sent to a spcific lambda function.
bus
  .when(this, "deleteRule", (event) => event["detail-type"] === "Delete")
  .map<Delete>((event) => ({
    id: event.detail.id!,
  }))
  .pipe(deleteFunction);

// New, young users interested in cat are forwarded to our sister team.
bus
  .when(
    this,
    "catLovers",
    (event) =>
      event["detail-type"] === "Create" &&
      event.detail.interests.includes("CATS") &&
      event.detail.age >= 18 &&
      event.detail.age < 30
  )
  .pipe(
    functionless.EventBus<UserEvent>.fromBus(
      aws_events.EventBus.fromEventBusArn(this, "catTeamBus", catBusArn)
    )
  );
```
