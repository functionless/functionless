# GraphQL API

Functionless enables the development of GraphQL APIs by providing a thin framework over the top of AWS Appsync.

- See the [Why AWS Appsync?](./why-appsync.md) for a brief overview of Appsync and why you should consider using it.
- See the [Usage](./usage) documentation to jump right into building GraphQL APIs with Functionless and Appsync.
