Functionless [Integrations](../../concepts/integration) can be created using any class or functional interface. This section will walk through how to:

1. Create or extend an [Integrations](../../concepts/integration) on existing Resources.
2. Coming Soon: Implement new or use existing [Integration Types](../integration-types.md).
